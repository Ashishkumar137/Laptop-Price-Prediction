# Laptop-Price-Prediction
Price prediction of laptop based on the configuration
# Dataset 
This dataset contains Laptop prices , properties and configration of laptop , with a focus on price prediction. With a good amount of data on what price points sell the most, you can train machine learning models to predict the optimal price for a product based on its features and configrations.
